# Afflec Image Pre-processing

The `fit_from_images` pipeline expects Afflec capture data to be normalised into
portable graymap (PGM) assets before invoking the CLI.

## Workflow

1. Export raw Afflec captures as calibrated grayscale renders.
2. Project the measurements generated by the Afflec suit onto each render.
3. Write the measurement metadata into the PGM header using comment lines that
   follow the format `# measurement:<name>=<value>`.
4. Ensure the raster payload remains ASCII encoded (`P2` mode) so the extractor
   can parse the header without specialised tooling.
5. Save the processed assets to disk and call
   `python -m smii.pipelines.fit_from_measurements --images <paths...>`.

The extractor aggregates measurements from all provided images. When duplicate
measurement names appear across files the numeric values must match; otherwise
execution fails with a `MeasurementExtractionError`.

## Generating Sample Assets

Sample fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/afflec/`. They illustrate how to
annotate images without distributing large binaries. You can regenerate them by
running:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path

TEMPLATE = """P2
# measurement:height=170.0
# measurement:chest_circumference=96.5
2 2
255
0 0
0 0
"""

Path("tests/fixtures/afflec/sample_front.pgm").write_text(TEMPLATE, encoding="utf-8")
Path("tests/fixtures/afflec/sample_side.pgm").write_text(
    TEMPLATE.replace("chest_circumference=96.5", "waist_circumference=82.3"),
    encoding="utf-8",
)
PY
```

These files contain enough metadata for automated tests while keeping the
repository binary-free. Replace the measurement names and values with the
outputs from your own pre-processing routine to drive production fits.
