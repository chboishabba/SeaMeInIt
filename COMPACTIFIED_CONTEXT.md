# Compact Context Snapshot

Date: 2026-02-06

## Current Direction
- ROM is treated as a first-class, schedulable operator with explicit levels (L0–L3), artifacts, and stop criteria; no seam solver or fabric changes in Sprint R.
- L0/L1/L2 sweeps are minimal and curated; L3 is a completeness certificate rather than more sampling.
- MoCap augments density later; it does not define ROM limits.
- Seam solvers and PDA/MDL stack remain frozen while ROM formalisation is delivered.

## Sprint R Core Deliverables
- Code: `smii/rom/pose_schedule.py`, `smii/rom/completeness.py`, and `sampler_real --schedule`.
- Data: `data/rom/sweep_schedule.yaml`, `data/rom/task_profiles/*.yaml`.
- Outputs: `outputs/rom/rom_samples_L0.json`, `rom_samples_L1.json`, `rom_samples_L2.json`, `outputs/rom/rom_L3_certificate.json`.

## Completeness Metrics
- Envelope convergence (99% below ε).
- Seam cost rank stability (Spearman > 0.98).
- MDL mass saturation (incremental MDL contribution trends to zero).

## Operational Fixes To Track
- Add mtimes/hashes to detect no-op ROM/heatmap runs.
- Switch measurement fixtures to explicit `measurements.yaml` ingestion (PGMs deprecated).
- Add runtime perf attribution to flag “GPU-assisted” runs that are CPU-bound.
