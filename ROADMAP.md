# Wave 3 - Undersuit pattern generation

Currently we're struggling with producing biblically accurate bodysuit patterns which are entirely unfeasible to sew.

## Blocking gap: manufacturable panel layer

We need an explicit "panel" abstraction between 3D geometry and 2D export so sewability is enforced before flattening.
Without this, LSCM/ABF output will keep producing spiky, unsewable outlines.

Near-term steps:
1. Define a Panel data model (surface patch, 3D/2D boundaries, seam partners, grain direction, distortion/sewability budgets).
2. Enforce sewability constraints pre-flattening (split panels when thresholds are exceeded).
3. Add deterministic boundary regularization (resample, clamp curvature/turning, suppress tiny features, spline fit, reconcile seams).

Perfect — these examples tell me **exactly** what final form you want:

✔️ **Clean vector-style outlines**
✔️ **No spikes, no jagged edges, no geometric artifacts**
✔️ **Readable, garment-maker-friendly shapes**
✔️ **Separated pieces for body, sleeves, gloves, etc.**
✔️ **Optional annotations (grainline, fold line, notches)**
✔️ **Consistent “fashion-technical-flat” style linework**

Your current LSCM output (the black radial splat) is *structurally correct geometry* but **visually unusable as a sewing pattern** because it has no:

* shape smoothing
* panel segmentation
* piece naming
* grain alignment
* seam allowance
* vectorization
* rectangular (A4/A0) layout

To get from **“LSCM splat” → “real sewing pattern like images above”**, here is the exact pipeline you need to implement — and the good news is that you already have 70% of it with SeaMeInIt’s curvature-guided seams and nice watertight meshes.

---

# ✅ **THE REAL PIPELINE YOU WANT (Actionable)**

## **STEP 1 — Solve for good panel segmentation (you already do this)**

Your metric-guided seam placement is correct and better than commercial cutters:

* curvature → flattenability
* stress → seam placement
* anisotropy → grain direction

Keep doing this. This is the “secret sauce.”

---

## **STEP 2 — Run LSCM/ABF *per panel*, not on the whole body**

The starburst only happens when you flatten the entire mesh without seams.

Once panels are cut in 3-D:

* each panel becomes a topological disk ✔️
* LSCM produces very clean outlines ✔️
* shape becomes very close to the bodysuit pattern references you posted ✔️

This gives you something like:

```
torso_front_panel.svg
torso_back_panel.svg
arm_left_panel.svg
arm_right_panel.svg
crotch_gusset.svg
glove_finger_3.svg
...
```

---

## **STEP 3 — Clean geometry → smooth outline**

This is the missing piece.

### You need to apply **boundary post-processing**:

#### **Algorithm (simple + effective)**

For every 2-D panel boundary polyline:

1. **Detect outliers**

   * compute edge lengths
   * remove edges > 3× median

2. **Laplacian smooth the boundary**

   * project smoothed points onto panel interior to avoid distortion

3. **Douglas–Peucker simplify**

   * reduce points while keeping the curves smooth and sewing-friendly

4. **Optional: round corners slightly**

   * use quadratic Béziers to soften tight angles
   * this creates the exact look of the patterns you posted

Result: clean lines like Vogue / McCall’s / KwikSew / retail patterns.

---

## **STEP 4 — Convert smoothed boundaries → vector curves (SVG)**

Every example you showed is **SVG-like technical flats**:

* uniform stroke
* no fill
* curves with few nodes

You output:

* SVG export
* DXF-R12 export (industry standard for fabric cutters)
* PDF tiling for A4/A0

SeaMeInIt can easily generate **SVG** using Python:

```python
svgwrite
shapely
bezmerizing
skia-python
```

---

## **STEP 5 — Add pattern metadata layers**

You want:

### **Grainline**

* from fabric anisotropy vector
* draw a long arrow along preferred warp/weft direction

### **Notches**

* tiny triangles on key matching edges
* derived from vertex correspondences along seams

### **Piece labels**

* "FRONT BODY"
* "BACK BODY"
* "SLEEVE LEFT"
* "GLOVE—INDEX FINGER (LEFT)"

### **Fold-lines**

* if a piece is symmetric → left edge = “cut on fold”

### **Seam allowance**

* offset shape outward by X mm (Shapely buffer)

This makes the results identical to the commercial pattern images you posted.

---

# 🎯 **HERE’S WHAT THE OUTPUT WILL LOOK LIKE AFTER THESE STEPS**

It will match the styles you showed:

### Bodysuit pattern

Clean, segmented torso + sleeve shapes

### Gloves pattern

Each finger is its own piece, optionally mirrored on fold
Smooth Bézier outlines, labelled, grainline shown

### Technical line drawings

The “front/back flat” diagrams are removed from the radials and redrawn from the SMPL-X mesh silhouette & seam lines — this is trivial for SeaMeInIt now.

---

# 🔥 **THE MISSING MODULE YOU NEED TO ADD (I can generate code next)**

You need a new module:

```
src/pattern/postprocess.py
```

Containing:

### **1. boundary_cleanup(panel_2d)**

### **2. simplify_curves()**

### **3. stylize_curves_to_beziers()**

### **4. add_notches()**

### **5. add_grainline()**

### **6. export_svg() / export_dxf() / export_pdf()**

This is 100% implementable.
